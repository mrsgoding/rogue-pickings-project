          <h1>A <span>Fresher</span> Life</h1>
      </header>
          <p>We believe in digging to our roots - both in life and in our food. Back in 2008, we grew tired
      of feeding our bodies unhealthy food and then feeling the negative effects as a result. We grew
      tired of seeing our families, friends, and communities suffer from an apparent lack of sustainably
      grown, whole foods. So we decidied to do something about it. We dug down to our roots right in our local communities'
      backyards. We decided to do something about this problem. That something is Rogue Pickings, and it has given us a fresher life.
      We hope it will do the same for you.</p>
